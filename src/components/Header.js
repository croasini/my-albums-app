      <h2>
        Explore the discography of one of the most iconic Spanish singers of all
        time.
      </h2>
      <h4>
        Ana Torroja is especially known for being Mecano's lead singer. Once the
        trio was dissolved in early 1998 –leaving an incalculable legacy for
        music in Spanish–, the Madrid native decided to embark on a career as a
        soloist to demonstrate more of her own talent.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Ana's unique voice has made her a coveted target for music producers
        from all music genres: whether it's the ethereal 1997 debut 'Puntos
        Cardinales' (produced by Tony Mansfield and recorded in Abbey Road) or
        her latest experimentations with retrofuturistic electro-pop, house and
        disco in her 2021 'Mil Razones' album (co-produced by rising Spanish
        stars Rosalía, El Guincho and Alizzz), her eclectic discography is worth
        paying tribute to.
